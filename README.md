 built this as a **practice project** to improve my front-end development skills and get hands-on with real coding.

## 🚀 About the Project
This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.  
I also tried to make it look attractive using **glassmorphism UI**, shadows, and hover effects.

## 🎯 Features
- Fully functional calculator (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
- Modern and clean UI using pure CSS
- Responsive design that adapts to mobile screens
- Hover and click animations
- Keyboard-friendly input (coming soon feature)
